                <p class="subheading">Discovery</p>
                <p>Initially, my primary objective was to define the goals of the Virtual Assistant Sam project. I sought to explore the potential integration of various Arduino components into a unified system.</p>
                <p>Moreover, I evaluated the capabilities of Tinkercad software, considering how it could enhance the design and development process by providing virtual prototyping and hardware simulations.</p>
                <p>-</p>
                <p class="subheading">Design</p>
                <p>The design phase encompassed the creation of a user-friendly interface for Virtual Assistant Sam. I aimed to develop an interface with a wide range of built-in commands that would provide a seamless and intuitive user experience.</p>
                <p>-</p>
                <p class="subheading">Development</p>
                <p>In the development phase, I focused on writing the software for Virtual Assistant Sam. This involved implementing a range of commands and interactions for the assistant. Simultaneously, I undertook the coding of Arduino components to ensure their smooth integration with the assistant.</p>
                <p>-</p>
                <p class="subheading">Testing & Quality Assurance</p>
                <p>Comprehensive testing was the hallmark of the project's quality assurance phase. Functional testing involved rigorous checks to ensure the accuracy and reliability of Virtual Assistant Sam's responses to commands.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, I tested the seamless interaction between the assistant and the Arduino components, using Tinkercad to simulate interactions and validate component connections. User experience testing and systematic quality checks helped ensure a polished final product.</p>
                <p>-</p>
                <p class="subheading">Delivery</p>
                <p>Upon project completion, I wrote detailed documentation outlining the development process. The project remains open for future developments, with the possibility of updates and enhancements to both the software and hardware aspects.</p>
